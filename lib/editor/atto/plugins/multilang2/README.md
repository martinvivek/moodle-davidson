=========================

![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.6-blue.svg) ![Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/supported-2.9%2C%203.0%2C%203.1-green.svg)

This plugin will make the creation of multilingual contents on Moodle much more easier with Atto editor.

The plugin is developed to work with [IÃ±aki Arenaza's multilang2 filter](https://github.com/iarenaza/moodle-filter_multilang2), and the idea is based on [his plugin for TinyMCE editor](https://github.com/iarenaza/moodle-tinymce_moodlelang2).

## Current version
The latest release is the v1.6 (build 2016042800) for Moodle 2.9, 3.0 and 3.1. Checkout [v2.9.1.6](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/releases/tag/v2.9.1.6), [v3.0.1.6](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/releases/tag/v3.0.1.6), and [v3.1.1.6](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/releases/tag/v3.1.1.6) releases, respectively.

## Changes from v1.5
 - Fix issue "Filepicker not loading when grading assignment" (see [issue 17](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/issues/17)).

## Requirements
