this ws was written in davidson to works with drupal davidson site for 2 purposes:
1. unenroll user from a course (user that is registered to moodle to other courses
    and wants to cancel a specific course)
2. un-suspend a suspended user in a course ( user that registered thru a form and didnt pay,
    or cant use the course for some reason - registration unit can un-suspend him, using their drupal)
