      | student1 | C1     | student        |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I set the following administration settings values:
      | enableavailability | 1 |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "page" to section "1"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name         | Restricted page          |
      | Description  | Need to enter a password |
      | Page content | Some page content        |
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction" "button"
    And I click on "Password" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    And I set the field "Password" to "Testing123"
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    And I log out

  Scenario: A student attempts to enter a password to access the page activity
    When I log in as "student1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    Then I should see "Restricted page"
    And I should see "Not available unless: You enter the correct password"

    When I click on "Restricted page" "text"
    Then I should not see "Some page content"
    And I should see "Not available unless: You enter the correct password"

    When I click on "You enter the correct password" "text"
    And I set the field "availability_password" to "Guess 1"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Password incorrect"
    And I press "Cancel"
    And I click on "Restricted page" "text"
    And I should not see "Some page content"
    And I should see "Not available unless: You enter the correct password"

    When I click on "You enter the correct password" "text"
    And I set the field "availability_password" to "Testing123"
    And I press "Submit"
    And I wait to be redirected
    Then I should see "Some page content"
